      We guarantee results from our marketing platform, ensuring a minimum
      number of admission forms filled based on the plan chosen. In the basic
      plan, we guarantee a minimum of 3 admission forms, 30 in the advanced
      plan, and 300 in the pro plan. In order to qualify for this guarantee,
      clients must meet certain requirements. Firstly, clients must have
      submitted demo lectures showcasing their school's educational offerings.
      Additionally, they should accurately provide the location and name of
      their school. If clients choose to include video ads, it is essential that
      these videos contain at least one clear call to action prompting viewers
      to fill out the provided admission form. While clients can mention their
      school's fees in the video, the actual fees charged must align with the
      information provided in the video and any other details shared by the
      client.The fees of the respective institute must comply with the limits
      set by the Government of India at the time of placing ads. Moreover,
      clients should ensure that all school details are accurately provided. By
      adhering to these guidelines, clients can maximize their chances of
      receiving the guaranteed number of filled admission forms through our
      marketing platform. Any content in the marketing materials that
      discourages or asks viewers not to fill out the admission form is strictly
      prohibited. Our aim is to generate genuine interest and encourage
      potential students to take the necessary steps to apply. Violation of this
      guideline may result in the termination of the marketing partnership &
      guarantee agreement. It is the responsibility of clients to provide
      accurate and truthful content, including demo lectures, location and
      school details, and video ads. Any legal disputes or problems arising from
      the content will be the sole responsibility of the clients. The owners of
      the websites reserve the right to change the terms and conditions at any
      time. For returns, customers must contact ceo@shikshafinder.com within one
      month of placing the order. Our vision is to create a business that
      supports all parties involved in this process. We genuinely strive to
      refund our users in case of failure to provide the promised returns.{" "}
